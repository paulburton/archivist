archivist: An Arch Linux repository build tool

What is it?
    archivist is a tool which builds a repository from a set of PKGBUILDs, and
    does so within a chroot environment to prevent cluttering the build machine
    with packages that aren't necessarily wanted.

    It is quite 'stupid' and takes the brute force approach of attempting to
    build all packages, then going back to the ones that failed (due to
    previously unmet dependencies within the repository) until it reaches a
    point where there are no more packages to build, or all the ones remaining
    fail to build. It builds packages in parallel within each build pass, with
    the aim of keeping the CPU busy at all times to minimise build time.

    If you run archivist on an x86_64 machine, it will build both x86_64 and
    i686 packages. Otherwise, it will build packages for the architecture of
    the machine it's running on.

    The first time archivist attempts to build a package, it will do so using
    parallel make where the number of jobs is equal to the number of CPUs in
    the machine. If the package fails to build then on the next attempt it
    will fall back to sequential make to avoid any problems that a package
    may have with parallel make.

Usage:
    ./archivist nameOfRepository /path/to/sources /path/to/dest

    The source directory should contain subdirectories which in turn contain
    PKGBUILDs.

    The destination directory will contain the built packages under a
    subdirectory corresponding to the architecture the packages are built for.

    Once archivist is finished, you should have a repository in your destination
    directory that you can add to pacman.conf with something like the following:

        [nameOfRepository]
        Server = /path/to/dest/$arch/

    Alternatively, you can copy the generated repository elsewhere, upload to a
    web server or generally place it anywhere pacman can access so long as you
    adjust the server line as appropriate.
